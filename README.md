# Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model for Image Anomaly Detection

This repository extends the ICLR’18 DAGMM architecture to the image domain, exploring both standard convolutional and residual-convolutional variants. We demonstrate significant AUROC and precision/recall improvements over a naïve flattened-vector baseline.

Please find attached the slides to the [presentation/submission](https://github.com/Aryan-IIT/gmm_anomalydetection/blob/main/slides/Extending%20modality%20in%20Deep%20Autoencoding%20Gaussian%20Mixture%20Models%20.pdf).

## 🔧 Requirements & Setup

* **Python:** 3.10
* **Install dependencies:**

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Datasets used: ```Intel Image Classification Dataset``` and ```MVTec AD```

## What’s Inside

* **Convolutional DAGMM (Framework 1):**
  A straightforward CNN-based encoder + GMM estimation network.

* **Residual-Convolutional DAGMM (Framework 2):**
  Adds skip connections in the compression network for richer feature extraction.

* **Loss & EM Updates:**
  Follows the original DAGMM’s energy-based sample scoring and EM update rules.

## Observations

* The flattened-vector baseline (64×64 → 4096) yielded **very poor** AUROC and precision/recall.
* Both convolutional variants significantly outperform the flat baseline—see the “Results” table for details.

## Future Work

* Extend to **multimodal** (audio + image) anomaly detection.
* Experiment with alternative architectures (GAN-based compression, feature-discrepancy methods).
* Tune hyperparameters and explore larger image resolutions.
